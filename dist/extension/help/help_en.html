For instance you can choose “Arial” and “Open Dyslexic”.</p> <h4 class="mb-1 mt-2">“Text case”</h4> <p class="ps-3">Allows you to modify texts display according to your needs: by capitalizing the first letter of each word, to lowercase or to uppercase all text.</p> <h3 class="mt-3">Reading help</h3> <h4 class="mb-1 mt-2">“Space between lines”</h4> <p class="ps-3">Allows you to increase the space between lines to ease reading.</p> <h4 class="mb-1 mt-2">“Space between words”</h4> <p class="ps-3">This setting allows you to add space between each word in texts.</p> <h4 class="mb-1 mt-2">“Reading mask settings”</h4> <p class="ps-3">Allows you to display a reading ruler, vertical or horizontal, or to display a more or less transparent reading mask so that you can concentrate on the part of the text you are reading.</p> <h4 class="mb-1 mt-2">“Other settings”</h4> <p class="ps-3"><strong>“Align texts to the left”</strong>: Justified texts often disturb reading. This option allows to disable text justification and to align all texts to the left.</p> <p class="ps-3"><strong>“List elements numbering”</strong>: Displays a numerical index in front of all list elements.</p> <h3 class="mt-3">Colours</h3> <p class="ps-3">Allows to define a font colour and a background colour.</p> <p class="ps-3">You can use either a combination of colours (“preset colour combination”) or redefine the setting (“personalized colour combination”).</p> <p class="ps-3">To go back to the original colours of the browser, you can cancel all settings by clicking on the Colours pictogram in the Quick settings bar, or uncheck the setting in the Colours tab.</p> <h3 class="mt-3">Behaviour</h3> <h4 class="mb-1 mt-2">“Directly jump to content whenever it’s possible”</h4> <p class="ps-3">This setting allows an automatic positioning on main page content, in particular by jumping navigation links.</p> <p class="ps-3">If the webmaster has not clearly marked up in the page code where the content is, this doesn’t work.</p> <h4 class="mb-1 mt-2">“Navigation on hover”</h4> <p class="ps-3">Displays a remote control with up and down arrows to scroll the page without clicking. When you hover over an element that you would want to click, just leave your mouse there and it clicks for you after a while (the delay you have defined).</p> <h4 class="mb-1 mt-2">“Automatic selection of elements”</h4> <p class="ps-3">Moves through all clickable elements in the page as well as all form elements. You just have to hit a key to stop it and show an action menu. To go back to browsing the page elements, just hit another key.</p> <h3 class="mt-3">Advanced settings</h3> <h4 class="mb-1 mt-2">“Remove layout”</h4> <p class="ps-3">Replaces site fonts with your default fonts (those defined in your browser). Moreover, content is displayed in one column linearly.</p> <h4 class="mb-1 mt-2">“Remove transparency effects”</h4> <p class="ps-3">Enables the deactivation of possible transparency effects of the page, e.g. grey veils on disabled buttons. This minimizes disruption when reading content.</p> <h4 class="mb-1 mt-2">“Remove background images”</h4> <p class="ps-3">Removes background images that could disturb reading. Keeps the foreground information only.</p> <h4 class="mb-1 mt-2">“Remove foreground images”</h4> <p class="ps-3">Removes images contained in the page that could disturb reading. They are replaced by their text alternatives. A link allows to display the image on demand.</p> <h4 class="mb-1 mt-2">“Reset” button</h4> <p class="ps-3">Restores the site to its initial state, by removing all settings you could have choosen with Confort<span class="text-primary">+</span>.</p> </section> <hr class="mb-5 border-1 opacity-25"> <section class="mb-5" id="compatibility_at"> <h2>Compatibility with Assistive Technologies</h2> <p class="ps-3">If you're using assistive technologies, please read this section.</p> <h3 class="mt-3">Screen readers</h3> <ul> <li> If your screen reader is in “mouse cursor” mode, a simple mouse hover can trigger a link if you chose a motor help like “navigation on hover”. </li> <li> The “automatic selection of elements” mode (looping through all clickable elements in the page) is very difficult to use with a screen reader, we don’t advise it. </li> </ul> <h3 class="mt-3">Screen magnifiers</h3> <p class="ps-3"> If you have configured your screen magnifier to alter colours in web pages, then the settings of Confort<span class="text-primary">+</span> may be perceived incorrectly; or they may conflict with your own settings. If so, choose a combination like “keep the original colours”. </p> <h3 class="mt-3">Voice control</h3> <p class="ps-3"> We have found, at least with Dragon Naturally Speaking, that motor help modes are problematic. We advise you not to use them in conjunction with this software. </p> </section> <hr class="mb-5 border-1 opacity-25"> <section class="mb-5" id="problems"> <h2>Troubleshooting</h2> <h3 class="mt-3">Cookies</h3> <p class="ps-3"> The Confort<span class="text-primary">+</span> service uses cookies, which are small text files that enable your browser to store your settings on your computer.
