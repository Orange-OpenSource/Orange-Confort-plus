## Deploying _Orange Confort+_ on your website

**WordPress site**
  
A tailor-made [Orange Confort+ for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/orange-confort-plus/) plugin is available. Thanks to [@RavanH](https://github.com/RavanH).

_N.B: This plugin is not directly maintained by the Confort+ core team, in case of issues please use the [plugin support from wordpress](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/orange-confort-plus/)_ 

**React App**

To integrate Orange Confort+ into a React application, you can use [orange-confort-plus npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/orange-confort-plus). Thanks to [@gbili](https://github.com/gbili).

_N.B: This package is not directly maintained by the Confort+ core team, please file issues using the [Github repo](https://github.com/meow-ch/orange-confort-plus/issues)_

**On your own domain**

A prepackaged version is available: simply add the `dist/serveur` folder to your website.

### Customize path

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If `dist/serveur/` content is placed at your website root, you do not need the following action.

Edit JavaScript files to change the following variables, or define them in your own script before Confort+ scripts inclusion:

```javascript
var hebergementDomaine = 'https://example.com'; // Your website origin
var hebergementFullPath = hebergementDomaine + '/myconfortplus/'; // Path to Confort+ folder
```

> [!TIP]
> Pay attention to the protocol you are using, HTTPS or HTTP.

### Call Confort+

To initialize Confort+, call it before the `body` closing tag using the correct path:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://example.com/myconfortplus/js/toolbar.min.js"></script>
```

> [!NOTE]
> User settings are saved onto your domain and are never shared with other websites, or extension.


### Branding

If the button doesn't comply with your brand, you can create a link that will trigger Confort+.
To do so, just include those scripts along with the aforementioned:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
	accessibilitytoolbar_custom = {
		// MANDATORY
		// ID of the target container which will include the link. If not null, activate the display in link mode. The link will be added as the last element of the target container.
		idLinkModeContainer : "id_target_container",

		// OPTIONAL
		// CSS class applied on the link to unify its appearance with the site.
		cssLinkModeClassName : "linkClass",

		// OPTIONAL
		// When the service is displayed as a link in the page, a skip link is automatically added at the top of the page. If you already have a group of skip links, you can specify the target container where the skip link will be added. The link will be added as the last element of the target container.
		idSkipLinkIdLinkMode : "",

		// OPTIONAL
		// CSS class applied on the skip link
		cssSkipLinkClassName : ""
	};
</script>
```

## Contribute

### Clone

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/Orange-Confort-plus.git
```

### Install dependencies
```shell
npm ci
```

### Start local server
```shell
npm start
```

It should build all the things and open your browser to `http://localhost:9010`.

You're ready to update files in `/src`: any changes will trigger a build and reload your browser.

For mor specific needs, take a look at existing scripts in our `package.json`.

### Build all the things

To build HTML, CSS, JS and static assets for both the docs and the extension, run:
```shell
npm run build
```

### Extension-specific scripts

We're using [Mozilla's web-ext](https://github.com/mozilla/web-ext) to ease our development workflow.

#### Package extension

A packaging script based on `web-ext build` exists for both Firefox and chromium, taking care of their specific `manifest.json` using npm `pre`-hook.
```shell
npm run zip
```

#### Lint extension

Based on `web-ext lint` (using addons-linter under the hood), we're linting the Firefox package.
```shell
npm run lint:ext
```

#### Load extension

`web-ext run` is used to load extension. There's a separate script for Firefox and Chrome.
```shell
npm run load:firefox
npm run load:chrome
```

> [!Warning]
> As of today, those scripts are quite buggy on Ubuntu if you use Firefox through snap. See #108 for more context.

### Work on Confort+ website

If you need to work on Confort+ very own website, there's a specific script:

```shell
npm run start:docs
```

### Modify Confort+ icon-font

A custom icon-font is used in Confort+ toolbar. If you need to modify it, you're encouraged to use [IcoMoon app](https://icomoon.io/app/) and import [existing IcoMoon settings](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/Orange-Confort-plus/blob/main/src/fonts/Confort%20Plus.json).

You can find a detailed workflow in [Boosted v4.6 documentation for icons](https://boosted.orange.com/docs/4.6/extend/icons/).
