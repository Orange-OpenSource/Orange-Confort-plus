## Deploying _Orange Confort+_ on your website

To deploy _Orange Confort+_ onto your domain, a prepackaged version is available: simply add the `dist/serveur` folder to your website.

### Customize path

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If `dist/serveur/` content is placed at your website root, you do not need the following action.

Edit `toolbar.min.js` JavaScript file to change the following property:

```javascript
this.path=`${window.location.origin}/my-custom-path/`
```

### Call Confort+

To initialize Confort+, call it before the `body` closing tag using the correct path:

```html
<script src="/my-custom-path/js/toolbar.min.js"></script>
```

> [!NOTE]
> User settings are saved in `localStorage`, thus depend on your domain. They are never shared with other websites, or extension.

## Contribute

### Clone

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/Orange-Confort-plus.git
```

### Install dependencies

```shell
npm ci
```

### Start local server

```shell
npm start
```

It should build all the things and open your browser to `http://localhost:9010`.
You're ready to update files in `/src`: any changes will trigger a build and reload your browser.
For mor specific needs, take a look at existing scripts in our `package.json`.

### Build all the things

To build HTML, CSS, JS and static assets for both the docs and the extension, run:

```shell
npm run build
```

### Extension-specific scripts

We're using [Mozilla's web-ext](https://github.com/mozilla/web-ext) to ease our development workflow.

#### Package extension

A packaging script based on `web-ext build` exists for both Firefox and chromium, taking care of their specific `manifest.json` using npm `pre`-hook.

```shell
npm run zip
```

#### Lint extension

Based on `web-ext lint` (using addons-linter under the hood), we're linting the Firefox package.

```shell
npm run lint:ext
```

#### Load extension

`web-ext run` is used to load extension. There's a separate script for Firefox and Chrome.

```shell
npm run load:firefox
npm run load:chrome
```

> [!Warning]
> As of today, those scripts are quite buggy on Ubuntu if you use Firefox through snap. See #108 for more context.

### Work on Confort+ website

If you need to work on Confort+ very own website, there's a specific script:

```shell
npm run start:docs
```
